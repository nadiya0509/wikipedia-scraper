# wikipedia-scraper

## Description

    Gets wikipedia data on the leaders of a number of countries using API.
    See header of the leaders_scraper.py file for the details.

## Notes 

    Due to the lack of time (I was working on the tech-talk),
    from task 3 on the code was placed directly into leaders_scraper.py.

## Installation

### The code needs creating a virtual environment. Type these commands:

-   In cmd:
    - pip install virtualenv
    - virtualenv wikipedia_scraper_env
- 
    In gitbash:
    - source wikipedia_scraper_env/Scripts/activate
    - python -m pip install requests
    - pip freeze > requirements.txt
    - Agree when VSCode asks to install ipykernel for the working of Jupiter notebook
    - with notepad: create file .gitignore and type there wikipedia_scraper_env/
